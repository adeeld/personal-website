  description: "Nice to meet you! I'm currently a CS major entering my last year at Rutgers University. With my skillset, my goal is to become a senior AI/Fullstack engineer. Just some quick info about me, I love learning about tech and the business world, whether it be startups, indie-hacking, or franchising, I love to dig deeper into anything I can get my hands on. In my free time, I love learning about AI, surfing, reading, playing poker with friends (no money), wrestling, watching UFC, and thinking how I can save the world, one line at a time.",
